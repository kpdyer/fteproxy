FTE Chat Example
================

A simple echo server/client using fteproxy.wrap_socket for FTE encryption.

Usage:
------
1. Start the server:
   python server.py

2. In another terminal, run the client:
   python client.py

The client sends "Hello, world" to the server, which echoes it back.
All traffic is FTE-encoded using the specified regular expressions.

Notes:
------
- Uses negotiate=False since both sides know the formats
- Client-to-server format: binary (0s and 1s)
- Server-to-client format: letters (As and Bs)

Based on code from: http://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html
