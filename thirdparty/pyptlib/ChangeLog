 - API change to expose server-side transport options. Fixes #8979.


Changes in version 0.0.4 - 2013-09-11
 - Add a subprocess management module, which should make it easier to
   write composed plugins such as obfs-flash, and the 2-INT termination
   behaviour specified in the PT spec.
 - Present a more object-oriented public API, and refactor internals to
   have better separation of concerns. Add a more complete set of tests.


Changes in version 0.0.3 - 2013-02-18
 - Restrict the MANIFEST.in file some more, so that no .pyc files
   sneak into the release tarballs.

   get into the release tarballs.
